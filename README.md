# Software Design for Flexibility

Exercises from the book written in Clojure.

I am implementing the examples/exercises in order they appear in the
book. When a particular function requires re-implementations, they
will be provided with suffixes e.g `-v1`, `-v2`, etc.

Also, this may not be "idiomatic clojure code", I am trying to be as
close as the implementation laid out in the book, however I might add
additional implementations with some own ideas e.g. using `futures`
for `parallel-combine`.

This repo is for Study purposes.
