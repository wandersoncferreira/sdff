# Software Design for Flexibility

Exercises from the book written in Clojure. 


The idea is to write then in order reaching every exercise proposed in
the chapters. When a particular function require additional
implementations, they will be provided with suffixes e.g `-v1`, `-v2`,
etc.

Also, this may not be "idiomatic clojure code", I am trying to be as
close as the implementation laid out in the book, however I might add
additional implementations with some different ideas e.g. using
`futures` for `parallel-combine`.
